The information, **We** store within our **DISCORD BOT**, is purely related to the longterm functionaliity of the application itself.

We do not wish to store user data longer than we possible have to. \n
The **End-User** at some point in the future will be able to opt out of certain data collections. 

The information stored is purely based on a functional purpose, 
Data collected varies from; UserData, UserMessages, or ServerData.

User Information that is based around a certain function cannot be removed, unless said user opts out of interactions with the specific function.

At this current time no data collection can be opt out of, the information collected will not be shared with any third parties.

Said data is required to continue functionality and nothing sensitive is stored, unless specically set via the end user.
